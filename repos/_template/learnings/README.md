# Repo Learnings

> Placeholder: This folder contains things Keywork has learned about this repo.

## What to Capture

As Keywork works on this repo, it should write markdown files here documenting:

- **Architecture patterns** - How the codebase is structured
- **Conventions** - Naming, formatting, testing patterns used
- **Gotchas** - Things that caused issues or confusion
- **Dependencies** - Key libraries and how they're used
- **Build/test commands** - How to build, test, lint, etc.

## Format

Free-form markdown. Create files as needed, e.g.:
- `architecture.md`
- `testing-patterns.md`
- `gotchas.md`
