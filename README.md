# Keywork

The connective tissue between intent and implementation.

Keywork is an autonomous coding platform that manages development of any repository through plan-build-iterate agent loops. It separates the agent system from the code it develops — Keywork orchestrates, working repos receive the commits.

- **Agents**: See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for agent reference and conventions
- **Humans**: See [HUMANS.md](HUMANS.md) for setup, workflow, and directory guide
