# Iteration Logs

> Placeholder: This folder contains logs from each Keywork iteration.

## Log Format

Each iteration should produce a log file, e.g. `iteration-001.log`, containing:

- Timestamp
- Which requirements were worked on
- Actions taken
- Errors encountered
- Outcome (success/failure/partial)

## Note

Verbose `.log` files are gitignored. Only this README is tracked.
Summary logs can be written as `.md` files if they should be preserved.
