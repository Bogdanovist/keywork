## Intended Contents

- Overview of the Ralph-style loop
- How state persists across iterations (git, progress.md, learnings)
- Project lifecycle (create → iterate → complete)
- Repo management (checkout, learnings, workspace isolation)
- Configuration options
- Safety considerations (sandboxing, max iterations)
